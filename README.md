# transliterate

This is a Hebrew transliteration program, written in PHP, by Josh Waxman.

Transliterator is a mechanism offered as-is to support users for the purpose of transliterating from Hebrew Alphabet into other alphabets.

After transliteration anyone might be able to read and pronounce the Hebrew words in his own alphabet.
